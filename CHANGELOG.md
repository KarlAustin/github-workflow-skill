All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Removed `skills/github-workflow/` directory which was registering as unwanted `wflow:github-workflow` command
- Moved templates and reference.md into `commands/wflow/` so everything lives in one place
- Updated all `SKILL_DIR` path references to `CMD_DIR` pointing to `commands/wflow/`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Slash commands now discoverable: split single `skills/github-workflow/SKILL.md` into individual `commands/wflow/*.md` files with explicit `name:` frontmatter fields
- Each command (`wflow:full`, `wflow:simple`, `wflow:setup`, `wflow:project-setup`) is now a separate file following Claude Code's one-file-per-command convention

### Changed
- `skills/github-workflow/SKILL.md` slimmed to shared context only (detection logic, conventions, formatting)
- Command-specific procedures moved to `commands/wflow/` directory

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Initial plugin release as `wflow`
- `wflow:full` — complete pipeline orchestrator (brainstorm → plan → review → work → security review → compound)
- `wflow:simple` — quick pipeline orchestrator (plan → work → security review)
- `wflow:setup` — project workflow setup (templates, labels, CLAUDE.md section)
- `wflow:project-setup` — new project bootstrap
- Detection and prompting for code-creation intent
- Progressive disclosure skill structure (SKILL.md + orchestrators.md + reference.md)
- Cross-plugin interface contract for `quality:security-review`
